Sliding Photo Puzzle
=================

Note: This app is a progressive web app, so after you run it for the first time, it will cache files locally to your device so it can be used offline. This also means that you will have to change the cache version if you update the app and therefore need to send new files to your end users.

Make this sliding puzzle your own with three easy steps!
1. Remix this app using the remix button
2. Upload the image you want in the assets folder, and click it to copy the URL
3. In client.js, change img.src to the URL of the picture you uploaded (remember to keep the quotes around the URL!). Search for ðŸ”¨ to find the place to make the change.
